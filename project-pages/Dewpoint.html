            In my current role as Lead Mechatronics Engineer at <a href="https://www.dewpointinnov.com/">Dewpoint Innovations</a>, a University of Sydney-backed startup, I have honed both my technical and leadership abilities. I am responsible for overseeing the development of prototypes and pilot installations, working closely with cross-functional teams and engaging with stakeholders, including the board, to ensure alignment with project goals.
Throughout my tenure, I have expanded my expertise in areas such as data analysis and predictive modelling. I have become proficient in using Power BI for data-driven insights and applying machine learning techniques through Azure ML to improve project outcomes. 
<br><br>
Additionally, I have strengthened my hands-on engineering skills by constructing electrical systems and wiring for prototype setups, both indoors and outdoors, and conducting detailed performance analyses.
My responsibilities also include generating weekly progress reports, ensuring projects remain on track, and continuously improving designs based on data insights and feedback. This role has allowed me to demonstrate a high level of independence and foster strong communication skills, all while driving innovation and contributing to the company's success.
