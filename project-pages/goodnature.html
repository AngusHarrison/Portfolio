             I have acquired a strong foundation in electronics design, implementation, and documentation. This was further by my Employment as a Mechatronics Engineer working within the Product Development team at <a href="https://goodnature.co.nz/">Goodnature</a>, a consumer based smart trapping company. <br><br>

             My career thus far has equipped me with comprehensive knowledge of electronic circuit conceptualization, refinement, and integration. At Goodnature my role  focused on developing, and testing a new IR trigger sensor for a consumer product. Naturally this involved creating and executing test plans. Debugging and reworking new hardware. While ensuring sustainability and electronics certifications are met. <br><br> 
             
             These projects were developed using NRF and ESP ARM32 chipsets within EDAâ€™s such as Altium. Firmware was developed simultaneously in C++. <br><br>
             
             Working In collaboration with Mechanical Engineers, Industrial Designers and Team Leads to prototype and integrate mechanical and design elements into the project was extremely rewarding and helped to develop my skills in these fields. <br><br>
             
             I thrive in this collaborative environment, working to solve dynamic problems and developing my mechanical and design skills. I pride myself on my professional interpersonal skills; founded in compassion, candour and never being afraid to ask questions.
             Previous coworkers have described me as charismatic, driven and goal oriented. I thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments. <br><br>
             
             Project management was at the core of working as an effective team member. Utilising rapid learning cycles, lean/agile sprints and design reviews (gates).Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written were necessary. Learning reports and design documentation were produced to a high calibre to aid in the consistent dialogue with project management. <br><br>
